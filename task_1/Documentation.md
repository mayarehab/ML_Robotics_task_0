## Problem definition
perform a linear regression model on an insurance dataset to predict the charge using both a sklearn library and implementation from scratch using python.

## Results
the results are almost the same. Although the r squared calculated from sklearn (0.78) is greater than the calculated from the scratch implementation using python (0.76)
